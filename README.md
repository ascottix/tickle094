# Tickle 0.94

Tickle is an arcade machine emulator. 

Version 0.94 is the last to support a native user interface for Windows and Mac OS X. Later versions will use the SDL2 library for greater portability, but won't support a native UI anymore.

Tickle supports about 40 machines including 1942, Frogger, Galaga, Galaxian, Moon Cresta, Nibbler, Pacman, Pengo, Pinball Action, Rally X, Scramble, Space Invaders, Vanguard and many more.

Hardware:
- 6502 CPU
- 8080 CPU
- Z80 CPU
- AY-3-8910 Sound Generator
- Namco Wave Sound Generator
- SN76477 Complex Sound Generator
- ... and **a lot** of custom hardware and discrete components!

## Notes on the source code

This code is old and I haven't tried to compile it in years. It shouldn't be difficult to recompile the emulator code but the user interface has probably become outdated and may give more trouble.

I have also included the code for the Rebound emulator, which is my first attempt at emulating a game without a CPU. It is not part of the main build.
